  <dl class="termlist">
    <dt><dfn>public key</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
  Cryptographic material that can be used to verify digital proofs created with a
  corresponding <a>private key</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>private key</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
  Cryptographic material that can be used to generate digital proofs.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="authenticated|authenticate">authentication</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
  A process by which an entity can prove to a verifier that it has a specific
  attribute or controls a specific secret.
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn> (DID)</dt>
  
    <dd>
  A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized
  registration authority and is often generated and/or registered
  cryptographically. The generic format of a is defined in [[DID-CORE]]. Many—but
  not all—methods make use of <a>distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT) or some
  other form of decentralized network.
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="controller(s)">controller</dfn></dt>
  
    <dd>
  An entity that has the capability to make changes to a
  <a>controller document</a>.
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="controller documents">controller document</dfn></dt>
  
    <dd>
  A set of data that specifies one or more relationships between a
  <a>controller</a> and a set of data, such as a set of public cryptographic keys.
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects">subject</dfn></dt>
  
    <dd>
  The entity identified by the `id` property in a <a>controller document</a>.
  Anything can be a subject: person, group, organization, physical thing, digital
  thing, logical thing, etc.
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="distributed ledger technology|DLT">distributed ledger</dfn> (DLT)</dt>
  
    <dd>
  A non-centralized system for recording events. These systems establish
  sufficient confidence for participants to rely upon the data recorded by others
  to make operational decisions. They typically use distributed databases where
  different nodes use a consensus protocol to confirm the ordering of
  cryptographically signed transactions. The linking of digitally signed
  transactions over time often makes the history of the ledger effectively
  immutable.
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="resources">resource</dfn></dt>
  
    <dd>
  As defined by [[RFC3986]]: "...the term 'resource' is used in a general sense
  for whatever might be identified by a URI." Similarly, any resource might serve
  as a <a>subject</a> identified by a <a>DID</a>.
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable credentials">verifiable credential</dfn></dt>
  
    <dd>
  A standard data model and representation format for expressing
  cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials, as defined by the W3C
  Verifiable Credentials specification [[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]].
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="">verification method</dfn></dt>
  
    <dd>
      <p>
  A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independently
  verify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as a
  verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
  verifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.
      </p>
      <p>
  "Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
  example, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key
  exchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the
  integrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification
  method, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words
  "verification" or "proof."
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt><dfn data-lt="">verification relationship</dfn></dt>
  
    <dd>
      <p>
  An expression of the relationship between the <a>subject</a> and a
  <a>verification method</a>. An example of a verification relationship is
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#authentication">authentication</a>.
